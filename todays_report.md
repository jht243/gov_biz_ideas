## [DELAWARE] SB 201: AN ACT TO AMEND TITLE 24 OF THE DELAWARE CODE RELATING TO REAL ESTATE BROKERS AND SALESPERSONS
**Description**: Section 1 of the Act exempts an individual not engaged in the business of “wholesaling” real estate from needing to be a real estate licensee. The business of wholesaling is when someone enters into an Agreement of Sale as a buyer, then markets the property and assigns that agreement to a different buyer and collects a fee for that assignment. While this process is unobjectionable under certain circumstances, at other times, it is used as a means to charge an excessive assignment fee, which is “equity stripping” of money that should go to the seller. The Act makes clear that marketing properties this way is the brokerage of real estate and must be done by a real estate broker. This is based on similar laws in Pennsylvania.
Section 2 of the Act includes the business of wholesaling under the definition of real estate services.
