Official Records & Inspection Protocols**\n\nThe process for handling records requests is now much more administrative:\n\n* \n**The Simultaneous Checklist**: When fulfilling a records request, the board must provide a checklist identifying exactly which records are being provided and which are not. \n\n\n* \n**Record Retention**: You must maintain these checklists in the association\u2019s official records for **7 years**. \n\n\n* \n**Response Timelines**: Failure to provide records within **10 working days** creates a legal \"rebuttable presumption\" that the board willfully failed to comply. \n\n\n* \n**Digital Redirection**: If the requested records are already on the association's website or app, the board can fulfill the request by directing the owner to those digital locations. \n\n\n* \n**Law Enforcement Requests**: The board must provide copies of records to law enforcement or prosecuting agencies within **5 business days** of a request. \n\n\n\n### **2. Meeting Management (Video Conferences)**\n\nIf the board uses video conferencing for meetings open to owners:\n\n* \n**Recording Required**: Every meeting conducted by video conference must be recorded. \n\n\n* \n**Digital Storage**: These recordings must be maintained as part of the association's official records. \n\n\n* \n**Physical Attendance**: Even if the meeting is online, the board must provide a physical location where owners can attend in person. \n\n\n* \n**Notice Requirements**: Meeting notices must include a hyperlink and call-in number for remote attendance. \n\n\n\n### **3. Voting & Election Procedures**\n\nFor boards using electronic voting or receiving ballots via email:\n\n* \n**Folder Audits**: Board members or agents must review all digital folders (including spam and junk) to ensure no ballots were missed. \n\n\n* \n**Sworn Affidavits**: A board member or manager must provide a **sworn affidavit** attesting that this digital folder review was completed. \n\n\n* \n**Designated Portals**: The association must designate a specific email address, website, or portal specifically for receiving electronically transmitted ballots. \n\n\n\n### **4. Structural Integrity Reserve Studies (SIRS)**\n\nFor residential buildings three stories or higher, the board faces new \"post-study\" workflows:\n\n* \n**Affidavit of Receipt**: Every officer and director must sign an affidavit acknowledging they have received the completed SIRS. \n\n\n* \n**Distribution Window**: You have **45 days** after receiving the study to either distribute a copy to every owner or send a notice that it is available for inspection. \n\n\n* \n**State Notification**: Within that same **45-day** window, you must notify the Division of Florida Condominiums (via a state-posted form) that the study was completed and shared with members. \n\n\n* \n**Budget Alignment**: You must obtain an updated SIRS before adopting any budget where the funding does not align with the most recent study's recommendations. \n\n\n\n### **5. Developer Turnover (HOA-Specific)**\n\n* \n**Title Conveyance**: At turnover, the developer must convey title to all common area property to the association within **90 days**. \n\n\n* \n**Financial Auditing**: The developer must provide audited financial statements from the date of incorporation through the date of turnover at their own expense. \n\n\n\nWould you like me to create a **compliance calendar** highlighting these specific day-count deadlines (5 days, 45 days, etc.) for your next board meeting?",

    "state": "Delaware",
    "bill_description": "Section 1 of the Act exempts an individual not engaged in the business of \u201cwholesaling\u201d real estate from needing to be a real estate licensee. The business of wholesaling is when someone enters into an Agreement of Sale as a buyer, then markets the property and assigns that agreement to a different buyer and collects a fee for that assignment. While this process is unobjectionable under certain circumstances, at other times, it is used as a means to charge an excessive assignment fee, which is \u201cequity stripping\u201d of money that should go to the seller. The Act makes clear that marketing properties this way is the brokerage of real estate and must be done by a real estate broker. This is based on similar laws in Pennsylvania.\r\nSection 2 of the Act includes the business of wholesaling under the definition of real estate services.",
